# Stick Sans

A modified version of [Hanken Grotesk](https://github.com/marcologous/hanken-grotesk) personalized for my own rebrand.
## Why Stick Sans?
Initially, I wanted to call this font "zeankun sans", however it is said to be very generic to just slap my internet alias with the "sans" suffix, so I have to travel myself back in time during 2020-ish, in which I was called a "stickmin" during that time. So, here it is, **Stick Sans.**
## Building the font
### Fontra
- Open Fontra Pak
- Drag and drop the `StickSans.fontra` folder onto Fontra Pak. It's inside the `sources` folder.
- Navigate to File > Export as OTF
- Voila! You're done!
